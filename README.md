# Packaging improvements that could be funded

This repository holds [FUNDABLES.md](./FUNDABLES.md): the list of tasks that the [Packaging Working Group](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG) is seeking funding for. We use this list to prioritize how we use [donations](http://donate.pypi.org/), and to write proposals asking for grants and directed gifts.

The Packaging WG uses three criteria to add tasks to this list:

 1. **the Python packaging community wants it**: there's already consensus among project maintainers, and if a PEP is involved it's been accepted.
 2. **fairly well-scoped**
 3. **fundable**: would happen much faster if the [Packaging Working Group](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG) got funding to implement the work. (So, it has to be legal and physically possible.)

See [past funded projects](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/04/sponsoring-python-packaging.html) for examples. All money goes through [the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

The list is roughly prioritized by urgency and impact, but is not a roadmap. Please contact the Packaging WG to ask us to estimate how much one of these improvements would cost; we'll get back to you within a few business days.

## Suggest a task

To suggest a task for the list, make a pull request against this repo. We welcome your suggestion.

## Maintainers and contact

This list is maintained and updated by the [Packaging Working Group](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG), a [volunteer work group of the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/workgroups/#packaging-work-group), approximately twice a month. Please [refer to the WG for administration and contact info](https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG#Administration_and_Contact).
